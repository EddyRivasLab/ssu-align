SSU-ALIGN is developed primarily on Linux and Mac OS/X systems. It is
tested on a variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. It is
meant to be portable to any POSIX-compliant system with an ANSI C99
compiler, including all UNIX and Macintosh systems. It should also
build on Windows systems with optional POSIX compatibility software
installed, such as Cygwin.
