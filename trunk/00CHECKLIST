Checklist for an SSU-ALIGN release.
EPN, Mon Jun  7 13:11:49 2010 [0.1] 
EPN, Thu Feb 18 10:59:10 2016 [0.1.1 release, using git, not svn, see
                               00CHECKLIST-0.1 for version of this document used for 0.1
                               release with svn]

This is based heavily on the 00CHECKLIST from Infernal
-------------------------------------

When editing this 00CHECKLIST, it is best to edit it only in the
trunk, not in a release branch. It isn't included in releases anyway.

Git repositories:       https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/ssu-align.git

                        https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/infernal.git
                        (infernal subdir, ssu-align-0.1-branch branch,
                        ssu-align-0.1 tag (0.1 release))

                        https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer.git
                        (infernal/hmmer subdir, ssu-align-0.1-branch branch,
                        ssu-align-0.1 tag (0.1 release))

                        https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel.git
                        (infernal/easel subdir, ssu-align-0.1-branch branch,
                        ssu-align-0.1 tag (0.1 release))

Trunk:                  https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/ssu-align.git/trunk

-------------------------------------
Subversion info for 0.1 development and release:

Subversion repository:  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/nawrockie/src/ssu-align/
Trunk:                  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/nawrockie/src/ssu-align/trunk

IMPORTANT: The vast majority of development for the 0.1 release was
done in a different repository: 

Subversion ssualign repository: https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/nawrockie/src/ssualign

(no dash between 'ssu' and 'align'). I changed the repository just
before the 0.1 release b/c I hadn't set up a trunk/ subdirectory in
https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/nawrockie/src/ssualign (nor a tags/ or
branches/). 

I put this 'ssualign' (not 'ssu-align') directory onto github just
before the 0.1.1 release:

Git:   https://github.com/nawrockie/ssualign-svn-pre-release.git

-------------------------------------
SSU-ALIGN post-0.1 release steps:
(I completely rewrote this part of the file from what's in
 00CHECKLIST-0.1)

1. Make whatever changes are necessary for the new release.

   If you need a working copy, get it this way:
   
   ---------------------------------------------
   Getting a working copy:

   Clone the ssu-align git repo:
    
     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/ssu-align.git ssu-align.git

  And clone infernal, infernal/hmmer and infernal/easel 
  subdirectories and switch them to the ssu-align-0.1-branch branches:

     cd ssu-align.git/trunk
     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/infernal infernal
     cd infernal
     git checkout ssu-align-0.1-branch

     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer hmmer
     cd hmmer
     git checkout ssu-align-0.1-branch

     cd ..
     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel easel
     cd easel
     git checkout ssu-align-0.1-branch
     cd ../..
   ---------------------------------------------

   Now make whatever changes you need to make for the new release.
   And commit them and push them to github. Do this separately 
   for each of ssu-align, infernal, hmmer, and easel.

2. Get a new working copy of the repo, but this time name it
   specifically 'ssu-align-release' and do it in ~/releases.

   Don't call this working directory ssu-align-xx, nor ssu-align! Call it
   ssu-align-release, because later "make dist" is going to try to create
   ssu-align-xx as its release, and because you want to recognize that
   it's different from src/ssu-align.  
   
   Note that with SVN we used to checkout only the 'trunk', but with
   git I don't think there's a way to checkout the 'trunk' subdir of
   the main repo. I think that I shouldn't have put the 'trunk' and
   'tags' directory level onto github but rather should have put
   what's in 'trunk' at the top-level. However, that's not how I did
   it. So we work around it here.

     cd ~/releases
     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/ssu-align.git ssu-align-release

     cd ssu-align-release/trunk
     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/infernal infernal
     cd infernal
     git checkout ssu-align-0.1-branch

     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer hmmer
     cd hmmer
     git checkout ssu-align-0.1-branch

     cd ..
     git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel easel
     cd easel
     git checkout ssu-align-0.1-branch
     cd ../..

3. [For minor bugfix releases, on branches]:

   Figure out what bug fixes need to be merged from the development trunks.

   I didn't merge ANY for the 0.1.1 release. Because none had been
   reported for ssu-align-0.1, and I don't want output for
   ssu-align-0.1.1 to be any different than ssu-align-0.1 (all that
   changed was the infernal/easel/devkit/sqc file which is related
   to a 'make test').
   
4. Write the release notes in releases/.
   To gather information, check:
   git commit logs in ssu-align or ssu-align-0.1-branch branches of 
   infernal, hmmer, and easel.

   When done, git add and commit the new RELEASE-xxx file.

5. Test.
   The SSU-ALIGN testsuite is currently relatively weak; and its based
   on PERL scripts. It needs to include valgrind tests for memory leaks, for example.
   The INFERNAL testsuite does not do memory leak checking either.

   But even so, don't rely solely on the automated exercises and bug tests.
   Run some anecdotal examples by hand too.

         cd ~/releases/ssu-align-release/trunk/
    	 autoconf
         (cd infernal/testsuite; ln -s ../easel/devkit/sqc .)
     	 cd ../..
         env CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure --prefix=/home/nawrocke/tmp/ssu-align
         make
         make check

   Run some anecdotes. Examples:
        infernal/src/ssu-cmbuild foo.cm infernal/intro/trna.sto
        infernal/src/ssu-cmsearch foo.cm infernal/testsuite/trna-regression.fa
   Run those with valgrind, too
        valgrind --orig infernal/src/ssu-cmbuild -F foo.cm infernal/intro/trna.sto
        valgrind --orig infernal/src/ssu-cmsearch foo.cm infernal/testsuite/trna-regression.fa

   Check the User's Guide.
      cd documentation/userguide
      make

   Check that the Infernal, HMMER and Easel user's guides build, but
   place correct release numbers on their covers (e.g. 's0.1.1').

6. Write (or update) release notes.
   For the first time on a new release branch, it's handy to look
   at the svn log. Replace "1534" below with the last release's SVN rev.
	 svn log -r 1534:HEAD | more
         cd easel
         svn log -r 314:HEAD | more
         emacs documentation/release-notes/RELEASE-${RELEASE}
	 svn add documentation/release-notes/RELEASE-${RELEASE}

	 repo=https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/

	 Different revision numbering histories:
	 nawrockie/src is relevant for ssu-align
	 eddys/src     is relevant for infernal/ and hmmer/
	 eddys/easel   is relevant for easel
                                           
          nawrockie/src/            eddys/src/               eddys/easel/
   Release   from-rev   to-rev      from-rev    to-rev    from-rev     to-rev
   -------   --------   ------      --------    ------    ---------    ---------
   0.1:             -    1088              -      3307            -         616
   
   These release notes will be merged back into the trunk later, if
   we're in a branch.

7. Update the copyright, year, version stamps. 
   * Edit configure.ac: make sure version, date, copyright info is set correctly.
     Do this in infernal, hmmer and easel too, they won't use their configure's
     unless someone goes in there and manually does it, but they should
     be updated (e.g. version s0.1.1).
       emacs configure.ac
       emacs infernal/configure.ac
       emacs infernal/easel/configure.ac
       emacs infernal/hmmer/configure.ac
       autoconf; (cd infernal; autoconf); (cd infernal/hmmer; autoconf); (cd infernal/easel; autoconf);
       ./configure
       . release-notes/LICENSE.sh

   NOTE for 0.1.1, the hmmer autoconf does NOT work, I've decided to
   leave it this way, that is, ship 0.1.1 with a broken configure in
   infernal/hmmer/configure. Nobody should be using that file anyway.
   And the configure in 0.1's infernal/hmmer/ doesn't work either,
   albeit for a different reason.

8. Test a 'make dist' tarball:
   I recommend doing a 'make dist' at this and testing that it
   includes the exact set of files that you want. Sean's 00CHECKLIST
   does not include this step here (he does include it later), but I
   found this is good to do before Tagging. 

          make RELEASE=0.1.1 dist
	  cd ../
	  cp ssu-align-0.1.1.tar.gz /am/ftp-pub/nawrocki/
          
   Download it to another computer from
   http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/nawrocki/
   and look at it. And do the INSTALL.

9. CAN'T DO THIS STEP AS OF 0.1.1 RELEASE. COMPILE FARM DOES NOT EXIST.
   Test the 'dist' tarball on ALL compile farm nodes.
   Ensure that:
     - "./configure --enable-debugging; make" gives no warnings and
        builds successfully.
     -  "./configure --prefix some-local-path; make; make install; make check;"
        Builds successfully and passes all tests.

10. Commit to git; include release number in the log message
	 git commit -m "0.1.1 release"
    Remember to separately commit in infernal, hmmer and easel 
    if changes were made there.

11. Tag.

     cd ~/releases/ssu-align-release/trunk
     git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Version 0.1.1"

     cd infernal
     git tag -a ssu-align-0.1.1 -m "SSU-ALIGN version 0.1.1"

     cd hmmer    
     git tag -a ssu-align-0.1.1 -m "SSU-ALIGN version 0.1.1"

     cd ../easel
     git tag -a ssu-align-0.1.1 -m "SSU-ALIGN version 0.1.1"
        
   Note: if you screw up somewhere below, and need to come back and
   re-tag, you must delete the previous tagged versions first:
   I've never actually done it, but found this online:

     cd ~/releases/ssu-align-release/trunk
     git tag -d v0.1.1 
     git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.1
        
     cd infernal
     git tag -d ssu-align-0.1.1 
     git push origin :refs/tags/ssu-align-0.1.1

     cd hmmer    
     git tag -d ssu-align-0.1.1 
     git push origin :refs/tags/ssu-align-0.1.1

     cd ../easel
     git tag -d ssu-align-0.1.1 
     git push origin :refs/tags/ssu-align-0.1.1

13. Put on the FTP site. 
    NOT SURE HOW TO DO THIS YET, SINCE SEAN IS NOW AT HARVARD. 
    I WILL UPDATE POST 0.1.1 RELEASE AFTER I'VE DONE IT.

    This is how I did it for ssu-align-0.1 (OLD at beginning of each
    0.1 line):

OLD    from ~/releases/ssu-align-0.1/

OLD    scp README selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/
OLD    scp documentation/release-notes/RELEASE-0.1 selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/00RELEASE
OLD    scp COPYRIGHT selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/
OLD    scp LICENSE selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/
OLD    scp Userguide.pdf selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/
OLD    scp ../ssu-align-0.1.tar.gz selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/
OLD    (IN THE FUTURE, DO ssh selab  rm -f /opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align/ssu-align.tar.gz
OLD    ssh selab  "(cd /opt/www/ftp/pub/software/ssu-align; ln -s ssu-align-0.1.tar.gz ssu-align.tar.gz)"
    
14. Update the web site
    NOT SURE HOW TO DO THIS YET, SINCE SEAN IS NOW AT HARVARD. 
    I WILL UPDATE POST 0.1.1 RELEASE AFTER I'VE DONE IT.

    This is how I did it for ssu-align-0.1 (OLD at beginning of each
    0.1 line):

OLD	 cd ~/web/selab/
OLD	 emacs software.html
OLD      make test
OLD      svn commit
	 
OLD    Email Sean to do the final 'make' and push the webpages live.	 

15. Clean up. 

	cd ~/releases
        mv ssu-align-0.1.1.tar.gz ~/Archives/
        cd ssu-align-release
	make distclean
        cd ../ssu-align-0.1.1
	make distclean (ONLY AFTER GORAN HAS INSTALLED THE SOFTWARE!)
