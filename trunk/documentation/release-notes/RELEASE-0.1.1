SSU-ALIGN 0.1.1 release notes
EPN, Fri Feb 19 18:21:21 2016
________________________________________________________________

SSU-ALIGN 0.1.1 is the first update release for SSU-ALIGN 0.1.

Very little has changed since 0.1. The only changes are as follows:

- a bug fix (in infernal/easel/devkit/sqc) that enables 'make check'
  to run on systems that use new versions of Perl.

- a bug fix in ssu-merge that prevents a possible divide-by-zero
  error.

- a change to the Userguide, which now suggests using 'source' instead
  of 'sh' at certain installation steps.

- the SSU-ALIGN license has changed to BSD. See the LICENSE file for
  more details.

Because so little of the code has changed, the output of SSU-ALIGN
0.1.1 should be identical to that of 0.1, with the following excepton
of ssu-merge. If the divide-by-zero bug mentioned above is encountered
for v0.1 leading to a failure of ssu-merge, then v0.1.1's ssu-merge
should finish successfully.
