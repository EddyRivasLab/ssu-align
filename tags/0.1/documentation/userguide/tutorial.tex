\section{Tutorial: Creating, masking and visualizing SSU alignments}
\label{sec:tutorial}

Here is a tutorial walk-through of some small projects with
SSU-ALIGN. To follow along with this tutorial, move into the
\prog{tutorial/} subdirectory of the {ssu-align-0.1/} directory where
you unpacked and built the package.
The instructions in this tutorial assume that you have already
installed the package (see the Installation section)
and all of the SSU-ALIGN executable programs
in your PATH. For example, you should be able to run
\prog{ssu-align} by simply typing \prog{ssu-align}.

\subsection{Files used in this tutorial}

In the first section of this tutorial we'll use the following files in
the \prog{tutorial} directory:

  \begin{sreitems}{}
  \item[\prog{seed-15.fa}] a sequence file containing
    fifteen SSU rRNA sequences, created specifically for use in this
    tutorial. These are full or partial sequences from the archaeal,
    bacterial and eukaryotic default CRW seed alignments used to
    build the default SSU-ALIGN models.
  \end{sreitems}
