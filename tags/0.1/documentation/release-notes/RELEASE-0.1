SSU-ALIGN 0.1 release notes
EPN, Mon Jun  7 09:13:36 2010
________________________________________________________________

This is the first release of SSU-ALIGN. We consider this release to be
a prototype. It is fully functional and documented, but we hope to
improve it soon. In particular, we'd like to reduce the time required
for creating alignments. Alignment speed is currently about 1 sequence
per second.
